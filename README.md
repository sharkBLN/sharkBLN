## 🌊 The Shark Manifesto 🌊

```
While you swim in shallow repos,
I hunt bugs in the deep.
Code that works? That's just the start.
The best code makes devs weep.
```

## 🦈 About This Shark 🦈

- **Habitat**: The dark waters of Berlin's tech ecosystem
- **Diet**: Primarily feeds on buggy code, stale PRs, and unoptimized algorithms
- **Warning Signs**: Commit frequency increases before a major bite
- **Conservation Status**: Endangered (Works best when caffeinated)

## 🔱 Weapons in My Arsenal 🔱

```
🐉 Status: Hunting dragons in the wild
🦈 Threat Level: Apex predator of system threats
🔮 Secret Weapon: Multi-layered detection algorithms
```

**What lurks beneath:**
- 🔍 Authentication attack detection & brute force defense
- 🧠 System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- 🕸️ Network activity surveillance for suspicious connections
- 📁 Filesystem change detection in sensitive areas
- ⚡ Process monitoring for crypto miners and unusual activity
- 📬 Email alerting system with severity-based recommendations
- 💬 Slack integration for real-time threat notifications

**Future hunting grounds:**
- 🔮 Machine learning for anomaly detection
- 🌐 Advanced network traffic pattern analysis
- 🛡️ System integrity monitoring with unauthorized SSH key detection

## 🌑 Dark Ocean Activities 🌑

- 🦈 Building the Dragon Threats pipeline - detecting security breaches before they happen
- 🌊 Patrolling system depths for resource abuse and suspicious activities
- 🧠 Training machine learning algorithms to recognize attack patterns
- 🕶️ Monitoring network traffic for signs of predatory behavior
- 🐉 Developing advanced alerting systems that bite back at threats

## 🔮 The Prophecy 🔮

```
They say on the darkest deployment night,
When servers crash and tensions are tight,
The SharkBLN appears from the deep,
With patches and fixes to help you sleep.
```
