# 🦈 Nil aka sharkBLN – Creative Chaos Engineer

## 💡 About Me

🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪  
- 100% self-taught. No diplomas, just curiosity, caffeine, and a relentless urge to tinker.  
🟧🟦🟩  
- Everything here is hobby-based – pure fun, experimentation, and DIY energy.  
🟦🟪🟨  
- I code, design, automate, produce music, and build visuals. If it’s weird, creative, or experimental, I’m probably into it.
